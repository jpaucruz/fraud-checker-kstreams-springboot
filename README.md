# Fraud Checker Project

This project defines how to detect fraud operations in real time for a bank organization.

For this, it uses **Kafka Streams**, a client library for building applications, where the input and output are stored in Kafka clusters. It combines the ease of implementing applications in languages like Java, with the benefits of Kafka technology. 

If you want to learn more about Kafka Streams, please visit its documentation: https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/ .
